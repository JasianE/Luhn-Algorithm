Luhn Algorithm created after inspiration from Waterloo problem of the week
I had alot of fun doing this! But I suck at styling 
Edits needed: 
    Fix styling of html and css
        Html text should be centered
        Accurate numbers should be put on the left with a background colour of light green
        False numbers should be put on the right with a background colour of light red
